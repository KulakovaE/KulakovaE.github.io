The idea of this app is to help you to save your favourite meals and their rate. This app was part of the learning process I had with Udacity.

<span class=""><img src="/assets/images/MealList/ml1.jpg" alt="" width="60%" height="60%"/></span>
<blockquote>List of meals and possibility to delete them.</blockquote>

<span class=""><img src="/assets/images/MealList/ml2.jpg" alt="" width="60%" height="60%"/></span>
<blockquote>Add new meal with photo and rating.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The saved meals appears in the list.</blockquote>
