The Pitch Perfect app is Udacity iOS Nanodegree project and allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with four different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Super Slow, and Super Fast. The app has two view controller scenes.

- Record Sounds View: Allows users to record a sound.
- Play Sounds View: Allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.
